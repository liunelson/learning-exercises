# MNIST Database

This database is taken from [LeCun et al](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). 
It contains many labelled examples of handwritten digits (0 – 9) 
in the form of grayscale images (28 x 28 pixels), 
split between a training set (size = 60,000) and a test set (size = 10,000), 
perfect for testing out machine learning techniques.
